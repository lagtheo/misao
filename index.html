<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p> Lagrange theorem is one of the central theorems of abstract algebra. It states that in group theory, for any finite group say G, the order of subgroup H of group G divides the order of G. The order of the group represents the number of elements. This theorem was given by Joseph-Louis Lagrange. Although named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who published it in 1795, the method was first discovered in 1779 by Edward Waring.It is also an easy consequence of a formula published in 1783 by Leonhard Euler.

	Joseph-Louis Lagrange (born Giuseppe Luigi Lagrangia or Giuseppe Ludovico De la Grange Tournier;25 January 1736 – 10 April 1813), also reported as Giuseppe Luigi Lagrange or Lagrangia,was an Italian mathematician and astronomer, later naturalized French. He made significant contributions to the fields of analysis, number theory, and both classical and celestial mechanics. <br> <br>

In 1766, on the recommendation of Swiss Leonhard Euler and French d'Alembert, Lagrange succeeded Euler as the director of mathematics at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, Prussia, where he stayed for over twenty years, producing volumes of work and winning several prizes of the French Academy of Sciences. Lagrange's treatise on analytical mechanics (Mécanique analytique, 4. ed., 2 vols. Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1788–89), written in Berlin and first published in 1788, offered the most comprehensive treatment of classical mechanics since Newton and formed a basis for the development of mathematical physics in the nineteenth century.  <br> <br>

In 1787, at age 51, he moved from Berlin to Paris and became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He remained in France until the end of his life. He was instrumental in the decimalisation in Revolutionary France, became the first professor of analysis at the École Polytechnique upon its opening in 1794, was a founding member of the Bureau des Longitudes, and became Senator in 1799.  <br> 
So, in this article, we will discuss in detail the definition of Lagrange Theorem, its formulas, corollaries and theorems in detailed way.
