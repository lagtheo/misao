	<b>Lagrange's Theorem Statement:</b> <br> <br>
	<i> As per the statement, the order of the subgroup H divides the order of the group G. This can be represented as; <br> <br> &emsp; &emsp;|G| = |H| </i> <br> <br>

Before proving the Lagrange theorem, let us discuss the important terminologies and three lemmas that help to prove this theorem. <br> <br>

In group theory, if G is a finite group, and H is a subgroup of G, and if g is an element of G, then; <br> <br>

gH = { gh: h an element of H } is the left coset of H in G with respect to the element of G <br> <br>

And<br> <br>

Hg = { hg: h an element of H } is the right coset of H in G with respect to the element of G.<br> <br>

Now, let us have a discussion about the lemmas that helps to prove the Lagrange theorem.<br> <br>

<b>Lemma 1:</b> <i>If G is a group with subgroup H, then there is a one to one correspondence between H and any coset of H.</i> <br> <br>

<b>Lemma 2:</b> <i>If G is a group with subgroup H, then the left coset relation, g1 ∼ g2 if and only if g1 ∗ H = g2 ∗ H is an equivalence relation.</i><br> <br>

<b>Lemma 3:</b><i> Let S be a set and ∼ be an equivalence relation on S. If A and B are two equivalence classes with A ∩ B = ∅, then A = B.</i><br> <br>

<b>Proof of Lagrange's Theorem:</b> <br> <br>
With the help of the above mentioned three lemmas, we can easily prove the Lagrange statement. <br> <br>

Let H be any subgroup of the order n of a finite group G of order m. Let us consider the cost breakdown of G related to H.<br> <br>

Now let us consider each coset of aH comprises n different elements.<br> <br>

Let H = {h1,h2,…,hn}, then ah1,ah2,…,ahn are the n distinct members of aH.<br> <br>

Suppose, ahi=ahj⇒hi=hj be the cancellation law of G.<br> <br>

Since G is a finite group, the number of discrete left cosets will also be finite, say p. So, the total number of elements of all cosets is np which is equal to the total number of elements of G.<br>  <br>Hence, m=np <br> <br>

p = m/n

This shows that n, the order of H, is a divisor of m, the order of the finite group G. We also see that the index p is also a divisor of the order of the group.<br> <br>

Hence, proved, |G| = |H|<br>
