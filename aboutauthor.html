<h1> Joseph Louis Lagrange</h1>
<body>
	<p>
Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736–1813) is considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians in history. Born in Italy, he made his home in France before, during, and after the French Revolution. His most important contributions to modern mathematics related to number theory and celestial mechanics, and analytic mechanics; his 1788 book "Analytic Mechanics" is the foundation for all later work in the field.</p>

<h2> Early years of Lagrange </h2>
<p>
Joseph Louis Lagrange was born in Turin, the capital of the kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, to a well-to-do family on January 25, 1736. His father was treasurer of the Office of Public Works and Fortifications in Turin, but he lost his fortune as a result of bad investments.

Young Joseph was intended to be a lawyer and attended the University of Turin with that goal; it wasn't until the age of 17 that he became interested in mathematics. His interest was piqued by a paper he came across by the astronomer Edmond Halley, and, entirely on his own, Lagrange dove into mathematics. In just a year, his course of self-study was so successful that he was appointed to be an assistant professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy. There, he taught courses in calculus and mechanics until it became clear that he was a poor educator (though a highly talented theorist).

At the age of 19, Lagrange wrote to Leonhard Euler, the world's greatest mathematician, describing his new ideas for calculus. Euler was so impressed that he recommended Lagrange for membership in the Berlin Academy at the extraordinarily young age of 20. Euler and Lagrange continued their correspondence and, as a result, the two collaborated on developing the calculus of variations.

Before leaving Turin, Lagrange and friends founded the Turin Private Society, an organization intended to support pure research. The Society soon began publishing its own journal and, in 1783, it became the Turin Royal Academy of Sciences. During his time at the Society, Lagrange began applying his new ideas to several areas of mathematics:
<li>
	The theory of sound propagation. </li> <br>
 <li>The theory and notation of the calculus of variations, solutions to dynamics problems, and deduction of the principle of least action. </li> <br>
<li>Solutions to dynamics problems such as the motion of three bodies mutually attracted by gravity.
</li> <br>

<h3> Most Significant Contributions and Publications</h3>

<li>Lagrange's most important publication was The "Mécanique Analytique," his monumental work in pure math.</li> <br>
<li>His most prominent influence was his contribution to the metric system and his addition of a decimal base, which is in place largely due to his plan. Some refer to Lagrange as the founder of the Metric System.</li> <br>
<li>Lagrange is also known for doing a great deal of work on planetary motion. He was responsible for developing the groundwork for an alternate method of writing Newton's Equations of Motion, referred to as "Lagrangian Mechanics." In 1772, he described the Lagrangian points, the points in the plane of two objects in orbit around their common center of gravity at which the combined gravitational forces are zero and where a third particle of negligible mass can remain at rest. This is why Lagrange is referred to as an astronomer/mathematician. </li> <br>
<li>The Lagrangian Polynomial is the easiest way to find a curve through points. </li>
 <h4> Death  & Legacy</h4>
 <p>
Lagrange died in Paris in 1813 during the process of revising "Analytical Mechanics." He was buried in the Panthéon in Paris.  <br>
Lagrange left behind an incredible array of mathematical tools, discoveries, and ideas which have had a profound impact on modern theoretical and applied calculus, algebra, mechanics, physics, and astronomy.</p>
