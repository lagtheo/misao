 <strong>Corollary 1:</strong> </p>
  <i>If G is a group of finite order m, then the order of any a∈G divides the order of G and in particular am = e. </i> <br> <br>

Proof: Let p be the order of a, which is the least positive integer, so,

ap = e <br> <br>

Then we can say, <br> <br>

a, a2, a3, …., ap-1,ap = e, the elements of group G are all distinct and forms a subgroup. <br> <br>

Since the subgroup is of order p, thus p the order of a divides the group G. <br> <br>

So, we can write, <br> <br>

m = np, where n is a positive integer. <br> <br>

So, <br> <br>

am = anp = (ap)n = e <br> <br>

Hence, proved. <br> <br>

 <strong>Corollary 2:</strong> </p>
 <i>If the order of finite group G is a prime order, then it has no proper subgroups.</i> <br> <br>

Proof: Let us consider, the prime order of the group G is m. Now, m has only two divisors 1 and m (prime numbers property).<br>Therefore, the subgroups of G will be {e} and G itself. So, there are no proper subgroups. Hence, proved.

 <strong>Corollary 3:</strong> </p> 
 <i>A group of prime order (the order has only two divisors) is a cyclic group.</i> <br> <br>

Proof: Suppose, G is the group of prime order of m and a ≠ e∈G. <br><br>

Since the order of a is a divisor of m, it is either 1 or m. <br> <br>

But the order of a, o(a) ≠ 1, since a ≠ e. <br> <br>

Therefore, the order of o(a) = p, and the cyclic subgroup of G generated by a are also of order m. <br> <br>

It proves that G is the same as the cyclic subgroup formed by a, i.e. G is cyclic. <br> <br>
